            Front-End vs Back-End: What’s the Difference?

          <p class="txt-xl">Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web development. The front end
            is
            what users see and interact with and the backend is how everything works. Each side needs to communicate and
            operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the website’s functionality. </p><br>
          <p class="txt-xl">But what do these terms mean exactly?</p><br>
          <p class="txt-xl">In this article, you will learn about the differences between the two by examining the
            frontend and backend separately.</p><br>
          <h2 class="blue">Front End Development</h2>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">Frontend development is the creation and management of the front end of a website or
            application. The front end is the part of a site that users see and interact with. Developers ensure the
            accuracy of the code so that users can have a user-friendly experience when they interact with a webpage.
            This
            includes checking fonts for consistency, ensuring the functionality of menus and buttons and creating pages
            that are easy to navigate. <br><br>Frontend development focuses mostly on the look and aesthetic of a
            website
            from the users' perspective. Frontend developers often fill roles in web design, user experience (UX) design
            and user interface (UI) design.</p><br>
          <h3 class="blue">Front-End languages</h3>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">The front-end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>HTML:</strong> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end
              portion
              of web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext
              defines the link between web pages. You can learn this language with Geeksforgeeks Advanced HTML –
              Self-Paced course and master the concepts of advanced HTML.
            </li><br>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>CSS:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language
              intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web
              pages. Also, if you want to enhance your skills then enroll in Geeksforgeeks CSS Foundation – Self-Paced
              course and learn all new concepts of CSS.
            </li><br>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>Javascript:</strong> JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on sites to
              make
              the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhance the functionality of a website to run cool games
              and web-based software. Applicable in both front-end and back-end, Javascript is a key to becoming a good
              developer. So start your web-development journey with Geeksforgeeks JavaScript Foundation – A self-Paced
              course today.
            </li><br>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="blue">Front-End Framework</h3>
          <ul class="txt-xl my-2">
            <li>Vue Js</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>SASS</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>AngularJS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="blue">Back End Development</h2>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">Backend or Backend development is like behind the scenes of a movie or show or in our
            case, the frontend. Actions taken by the user are analyzed, fetched, and delivered back by the backend
            through
            the codes written. The person who develops the back end is known as the Back End Developer. The major work
            of
            a Back End Developer includes linking every aspect of the front end together and with the databases. The
            primary skills of a Back End Developer include knowing back end languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, etc.
            Other skills include a sound understanding of Database Management System(DBMS) and Application Program
            Interface(API). The back end is very crucial as it gives purpose or functionality to the beauty of an app or
            website. </p><br>
          <h3 class="blue">Back-End languages</h3>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">The back-end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>PHP:</strong> PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
              Since PHP code is executed on the server side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
            </li><br><br>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>Python:</strong> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems
              more efficiently. It is also a very important language for the back end and for mastering it you can take
              a
              look at Python Programming Foundation -Self-Paced course. This is a beginner-friendly course and will help
              you to build a strong foundation for python.
            </li><br><br>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing
              JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a
              programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language.
              We
              often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in
              production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.
            </li><br><br>
            <li class="txt-xl">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and
              platforms.
              It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available and for learning this one of the most popular
              languages you can check the Geeksforgeeks Java Programming Foundation – Self-Paced course. It will help
              you
              understand the proper framework, concepts, functions, and more.
            </li><br><br>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="blue">Back-End Framework</h3>
          <ul class="txt-xl my-2">
            <li>Django</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
            <li>Laravel</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="blue">Salary</h2>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">Salary expectations for these positions can vary too. The average base salary for a
            front-end developer is
            ₹6,03,961 per year. In contrast, back-end developers can expect to make a little more with an average salary
            of ₹7,03,918 per year. Actual salaries can vary based on the company your work for, your geographic location
            and your overall experiences and skills.</p>
          <h2 class="blue">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="txt-xl my-2">By now, the difference between the frontend and backend should be more evident, as well
            as the different
            activities carried by developers that work on both ends of the wire. In practical terms, the frontend means
            the browser and the backend, the server or, more recently, the cloud. <br><br>Web development is an
            interesting
            branch in the field of technology. Front end development is like the exterior of a house; The paint, the
            wall
            carvings, the wall hangings, or anything that a person can see and feel. The back end is like the electric
            supply, the construction materials which one cannot see, but is crucial for the house. It is only together
            that these two things make an application look and function in the best way possible. <br><br>If you enjoy
            both
            and feel equally excited and comfortable with all aspects of web application creation, then a career as a
            full-stack developer is what you want. <br><br>Whatever path you choose, there has never been a better time
            to be
            a software developer.</p><br><br>
